# AWS Scenario Based Interview Questions

# 1. Scaling a Web Application

# Question: You have a web application hosted on EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). The traffic to your application varies significantly, and during peak hours, the servers struggle to handle the load. How would you design a solution to handle variable traffic efficiently and cost-effectively?

# Answer: I would implement an Auto Scaling group to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic. I would define scaling policies using CloudWatch alarms that monitor key metrics like CPU utilization or request count. During peak hours, the Auto Scaling group would launch additional instances to handle the increased load, and during off-peak hours, it would scale down to reduce costs. Additionally, I would use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads to further optimize costs while maintaining the desired performance

# 2. Designing a Secure VPC

# Question: You need to design a secure VPC for a multi-tier application. The application consists of a web tier, an application tier, and a database tier. The database must not be accessible from the internet. How would you set up the VPC, subnets, and security groups to ensure the security and isolation of the database tier?

# Answer: I would create a VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones for high availability. The web servers would be placed in public subnets, and the application and database servers would be in private subnets. The database subnet would have no route to the internet gateway, ensuring that it’s not accessible from the internet. I’d use security groups to control access between the tiers, allowing only the necessary traffic, such as allowing the application tier to communicate with the database tier. I’d also configure a NAT Gateway in the public subnet to allow the private instances to access the internet for updates while keeping them secure

# 3. Cost Optimization

# Question: Your organization has multiple environments (development, staging, production) running on AWS, and you have noticed that your AWS bills are getting higher each month. What steps would you take to analyze and reduce the AWS costs without affecting the performance or availability of your services?

# Answer: I would start by using AWS Cost Explorer to analyze the current spending trends and identify the services that contribute most to the costs. Then, I would review the use of on-demand instances and consider switching to Reserved Instances or Spot Instances for long-running or flexible workloads. I’d implement Auto Scaling to ensure that only necessary resources are running at any given time. Additionally, I’d review S3 storage classes and move infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage options like S3 Glacier. I’d also set up CloudWatch to monitor underutilized resources, such as idle EC2 instances, and automate their shutdown during non-business hours in development and staging environments

4. Data Backup and Recovery
# Question: You are responsible for managing the data of a mission-critical application. The application runs on EC2 instances and stores data in RDS and S3. You need to ensure that data is backed up regularly and can be recovered quickly in case of failure. How would you implement a backup and disaster recovery strategy for this application?

# Answer: I would enable automated backups for the RDS database, which would ensure daily backups and transaction log backups. I would also create EBS snapshots regularly for the EC2 instances to capture the state of the data volumes. For S3, I would enable versioning and use lifecycle policies to automatically move older versions of objects to S3 Glacier for cost-effective long-term storage. To prepare for disaster recovery, I would replicate the critical data to another AWS region using Cross-Region Replication for S3 and RDS Read Replicas. Additionally, I’d create a CloudFormation template to quickly rebuild the infrastructure in another region if needed, minimizing the RTO and RPO

# 5. Serverless Architecture

# Question: You are tasked with building a serverless REST API that needs to scale automatically and handle thousands of requests per second. How would you design this API using AWS services? What considerations would you make regarding security, scalability, and cost?

# Answer: I would use Amazon API Gateway to expose the REST API, and AWS Lambda to handle the business logic. Lambda would automatically scale based on the incoming request volume, ensuring that it can handle thousands of requests per second without the need to manage servers. For the data layer, I would use DynamoDB, which can scale to handle high request rates and provides low latency. To secure the API, I’d use API Gateway’s built-in security features such as IAM roles, API keys, and Lambda authorizers for request validation and authentication. To minimize costs, I’d ensure that the Lambda function is optimized to execute quickly, as Lambda charges based on execution time, and I’d use DynamoDB’s auto-scaling and on-demand pricing models to keep costs predictable

# 6. Handling a DDoS Attack

# Question: Your application has been targeted by a DDoS attack, resulting in high latency and potential downtime. The application is hosted on EC2 instances with an ELB. What actions would you take to mitigate the attack and protect your application from future incidents?

# Answer: I would first activate AWS Shield, which provides automatic protection against common DDoS attacks. If the attack is more sophisticated, I would upgrade to AWS Shield Advanced for enhanced protections. To further mitigate the attack, I’d use AWS WAF to create rules that block malicious traffic, such as by filtering requests based on IP addresses, geographic location, or specific request patterns. I would also set up rate limiting in WAF to control the number of requests from a single IP. Additionally, I’d deploy Amazon CloudFront as a CDN in front of the application, which can absorb DDoS traffic and cache content to reduce the load on the backend servers. Lastly, I’d monitor the situation closely with CloudWatch and GuardQuestionDuty to detect any further suspicious activity and respond swiftly

# 7. Data Migration to AWS

# Question: Your company has a large on-premises database that needs to be migrated to AWS with minimal downtime. The database is critical to your business operations. What strategy would you use to migrate the database to AWS? How would you ensure data integrity and minimal downtime during the migration?

# Answer: I would use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to perform the migration. I’d start by setting up a DMS replication instance and configuring source (on-premises) and target (AWS) endpoints. First, I’d perform a full load of the existing data from the on-premises database to the target AWS database (likely Amazon RDS or Aurora). After the initial load, I would enable ongoing replication to keep the databases in sync during the migration period. To minimize downtime, I’d schedule the final cutover during a low-traffic period. During cutover, I’d stop the application’s access to the on-premises database, allow DMS to sync any final changes, and then redirect the application to the AWS database. To ensure data integrity, I’d use DMS’s data validation features and perform thorough testing on the AWS database before the cutover. Lastly, I’d have a rollback plan in place in case of any unforeseen issues

# 8. Implementing CI/CD

# Question: Your team is adopting DevOps practices and wants to automate the deployment of your application. The application is hosted on EC2 instances, and you use Git for version control. How would you implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services to automate the build, test, and deployment process?

# Answer: I would use AWS CodePipeline to orchestrate the entire CI/CD process. I’d start by connecting CodePipeline to our Git repository in AWS CodeCommit to automatically trigger the pipeline whenever there’s a new commit. The next stage in the pipeline would use AWS CodeBuild to compile the application and run unit tests. If the build and tests succeed, the pipeline would proceed to the deployment stage using AWS CodeDeploy. CodeDeploy would deploy the new version of the application to the EC2 instances, ensuring zero downtime by using a blue/green or rolling deployment strategy. Throughout the process, I’d use CloudWatch to monitor the health of the pipeline, and I’d set up SNS notifications to alert the team in case of any failures or issues.

# 9. Cross-Region High Availability

# Question: You have an application running in a single AWS region, but you need to make it highly available across multiple regions to improve fault tolerance and latency. How would you design the architecture to achieve cross-region high availability?

# Answer: I would start by deploying the application in multiple AWS regions to ensure redundancy. I’d use Route 53 with latency-based routing or geolocation routing to direct user traffic to the region that provides the lowest latency or is geographically closest. For the backend, I’d use Amazon RDS with cross-region read replicas to ensure that the database is available in all regions. I’d also enable S3 Cross-Region Replication to ensure that any data stored in S3 is replicated to another region for redundancy. For dynamic content, I’d use Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables to automatically replicate data across regions. Lastly, I’d use Amazon CloudFront as a global CDN to cache content and provide faster delivery to users worldwide. This architecture ensures high availability and improved performance across multiple regions.

# 10. Logging and Monitoring

# Question: Your application has been experiencing intermittent issues, and you need to set up a comprehensive logging and monitoring solution to diagnose and resolve the problems. How would you implement logging and monitoring for your application on AWS? What services would you use, and how would you configure them?

# Answer: I would use Amazon CloudWatch for comprehensive monitoring and logging. I’d configure CloudWatch Logs to collect and store logs from my EC2.
